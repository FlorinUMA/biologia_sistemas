	abstract = {Megalencephaly and macrocephaly present with a head circumference measurement 2 standard deviations above the age-related mean. However, even if pathologic events resulting in both megalencephaly and macrocephaly may coexist, a distinction between these two entities is appropriate, as they represent clinical expression of different disorders with a different approach in clinical work-up, overall prognosis, and treatment. Megalencephaly defines an increased growth of cerebral structures related to dysfunctional anomalies during the various steps of brain development in the neuronal proliferation and/or migration phases or as a consequence of postnatal abnormal events. The disorders associated with megalencephaly are classically defined into 3 groups: idiopathic or benign, metabolic, and anatomic. In this article, we seek to underline the clinical aspect of megalencephaly, emphasizing the main disorders that manifest with this anomaly in an attempt to properly categorize these disorders within the megalencephaly group.},

	abstract = {Megalencephaly is a developmental disorder characterized by brain overgrowth secondary to increased size and/or numbers of neurons and glia. These disorders can be divided into metabolic and developmental categories based on their molecular etiologies. Metabolic megalencephalies are mostly caused by genetic defects in cellular metabolism, whereas developmental megalencephalies have recently been shown to be caused by alterations in signaling pathways that regulate neuronal replication, growth, and migration. These disorders often lead to epilepsy, developmental disabilities, and behavioral problems; specific disorders have associations with overgrowth or abnormalities in other tissues. The molecular underpinnings of many of these disorders are now understood, providing insight into how dysregulation of critical pathways leads to disease. The advances in molecular understanding are leading to improved diagnosis of these conditions, as well as providing new avenues for therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {A recurring finding in autism spectrum disorder research is that head and brain growth is disproportionate to body growth in early childhood. Nordahl et al. (2011) demonstrated that this occurs in approximately 15\% of boys with autism. While the literature suggests that brain growth normalizes at older ages, this has never been evaluated in a longitudinal study. The current study evaluated head circumference and total cerebral volume in 129 male children with autism and 49 age-matched, typically developing controls. We determined whether 3-year-old boys with brain size disproportionate to height (which we call disproportionate megalencephaly) demonstrated an abnormal trajectory of head growth from birth and whether they maintained an enlarged brain at 5 years of age. Findings were based on longitudinal, structural MRI data collected around 3, 4, and 5 years of age and head circumference data from medical records. At 3 years of age, 19 boys with autism had enlarged brains while 110 had brain sizes in the normal range. Boys with disproportionate megalencephaly had greater total cerebral, gray matter, and white matter volumes from 3–5 years compared to boys with autism and normal sized brains and typically developing boys, but no differences in body size. While head circumference did not differ between groups at birth, it was significantly greater in the disproportionate megalencephaly group by around 2 years. These data suggest that there is a subgroup of boys with autism who have brains disproportionate to body size and that this continues until at least 5 years of age.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether nonreferred children with idiopathic megalencephaly show evidence of specific neurodevelopmental dysfunction compared with sibling control subjects and age-matched control subjects.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control study in a large, suburban pediatric practice. Subjects included 20 children between the ages of 6 and 15 years with a head circumference at greater than the 98th percentile, 19 siblings of these children with normalsize heads, and 16 age-matched control subjects. Standardized tests of language, academic achievement, visuomotor integration, motor function, and neurodevelopmental function were administered.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis, with control for age, showed a main effect for the presence of megalencephaly (F = 3.2; p {\textless} 0.05). Follow-up univariate analyses, with control for age, showed that children with megalencephaly had poorer performance on tasks of upper limb speed, visuomotor control, running speed, bilateral coordination, visuomotor integration, naming fluency, and minor neurologic indicators.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between idiopathic megalencephaly and external hydrocephalus in infants is discussed. Results show that so-called "benign" idiopathic megalencephaly in nonreferred school-age children appears to be a clinical entity associated with subtle motor problems and neurodevelopmental dysfunction.},

Aunque algunas personas con TEA pueden vivir de manera independiente, hay otras con discapacidades graves que necesitan constante atención y apoyo durante toda su vida, además sufren estigmatización, discriminación y violaciones de los derechos humanos, su acceso a los servicios y al apoyo es insuficiente a nivel mundial. Es bien sabido que la familia es el pilar más importante de un niño con TEA, de ellos depende la educación y los cuidados que deben ofrecerle al niño, las intervenciones psicosociales basadas en evidencias, como la terapia conductual y los programas de capacitación para los padres, pueden reducir las dificultades de comunicación y comportamiento social, y tener un impacto positivo en el bienestar y la calidad de vida de las personas con TEA y de sus cuidadores. Las intervenciones dirigidas a las personas con TEA deben acompañarse de medidas más generales que hagan que los entornos físicos, sociales y actitudinales sean más accesibles, inclusivos y compasivos. Por ello, mediante un tríptico y un cuadernillo se pretende plasmar información sustentada con un fundamento científico, en la cual permita que la familia participe más en cuestión del cuidado, atención y educación en los niños con TEA.},

We compare the features in 42 patients evaluated for physical and neuroimaging characteristics of MCAP and MPPH and propose a more global view of these syndromes based on classes of developmental abnormalities that include primary MEG and growth dysregulation, developmental vascular anomalies (primarily capillary malformations), distal limb anomalies (such as syndactyly and polydactyly), cortical brain malformations (most distinctively polymicrogyria, PMG), and variable connective tissue dysplasia. Based on these classes of developmental abnormalities, we propose that MCAP diagnostic criteria include progressive MEG with either vascular anomalies or syndactyly. In parallel, we propose that MPPH diagnostic criteria include progressive MEG and PMG, absence of the vascular anomalies and syndactyly characteristic of MCAP, and absence of brain heterotopia. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Expansion of the human brain, and specifically the neocortex, is among the most remarkable evolutionary processes that correlates with cognitive, emotional, and social abilities. Cortical expansion is determined through a tightly orchestrated process of neural stem cell proliferation, migration, and ongoing organization, synaptogenesis, and apoptosis. Perturbations of each of these intricate steps can lead to abnormalities of brain size in humans, whether small (microcephaly) or large (megalencephaly). Abnormalities of brain growth can be clinically isolated or occur as part of complex syndromes associated with other neurodevelopmental problems (eg, epilepsy, autism, intellectual disability), brain malformations, and body growth abnormalities. Thorough review of the genetic literature reveals that human microcephaly and megalencephaly are caused by mutations of a rapidly growing number of genes linked within critical cellular pathways that impact early brain development, with important pathomechanistic links to cancer, body growth, and epilepsy. Given the rapid rate of causal gene identification for microcephaly and megalencephaly understanding the roles and interplay of these important signaling pathways is crucial to further unravel the mechanisms underlying brain growth disorders and, more fundamentally, normal brain growth and development in humans. In this review, we will (a) overview the definitions of microcephaly and megalencephaly, highlighting their classifications in clinical practice; (b) overview the most common genes and pathways underlying microcephaly and megalencephaly based on the fundamental cellular processes that are perturbed during cortical development; and (c) outline general clinical molecular diagnostic workflows for children and adults presenting with microcephaly and megalencephaly.},

Over the past two decades since the discovery of GFAP as the culprit, several cellular and animal models have been generated, and much has been learned about underlying mechanisms contributing to the disease. Despite these efforts, many aspects of Alexander disease have remained enigmatic, particularly the initiating events in GFAP accumulation and astrocyte pathology, the relation between astrocyte dysfunction and myelin deficits, and the variability in age of onset and disease severity. More recent work in both old and new models has begun to address these complex questions and identify new therapeutics that finally offer the promise of effective treatment.},
